#Power Button
Raspberry Pi is an awesome and cheap computer allowing us to build interesting electronic projects 
and to gain expertise in electronics in general. So as it is cheap it lacks some features, like power button, 
which is not an issue for us, is it? You can buy a module to support this functionality around $20 or 
simply build yours and get some fun and valuable experience.
